# ProSoccer Technical Strategy

## Context

ProSoccer is the first multi-chain NFT online gaming platform that empowers soccer fans to create, build, and manage soccer teams while participating in gaming events. This platform addresses the limitations of traditional gaming by leveraging blockchain technology, specifically Stellar, for fast transactions and low fees. The platform will provide users with ownership and control over in-game assets through NFTs, enhancing the gaming experience with features like squad management, player training, and tournaments.

## Technical Strategy

### 1. Smart Contract Development Using Soroban

#### Purpose

Develop and deploy Soroban smart contracts to handle the core functionalities of ProSoccer, including user registration, NFT minting and transfer, player training, and tournament participation.

#### Smart Contract Implementation in Rust

##### NFT Minting and Management

```rust
use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, Env, Address, BytesN, Val};

pub struct NFTContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl NFTContract {
    pub fn mint_nft(env: Env, owner: Address, nft_data: BytesN<32>) -> Val {
        // Minting logic
        env.log(&format!("Minting NFT for owner: {:?}", owner));
        env.storage().set(&nft_data, &owner);
        Val::from("NFT minted successfully")
    }

    pub fn transfer_nft(env: Env, from: Address, to: Address, nft_data: BytesN<32>) -> Val {
        // Transfer logic
        let current_owner: Address = env.storage().get(&nft_data).unwrap();
        if current_owner != from {
            return Val::from("Transfer failed: not the owner");
        }
        env.storage().set(&nft_data, &to);
        Val::from("NFT transferred successfully")
    }
}
```

##### Player Training

```rust
use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, Env, Address, Symbol, Val};

pub struct TrainingContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl TrainingContract {
    pub fn train_player(env: Env, owner: Address, player_id: Symbol, attribute: Symbol, value: i32) -> Val {
        // Training logic
        let key = (owner, player_id, attribute.clone());
        let current_value: i32 = env.storage().get(&key).unwrap_or(0);
        env.storage().set(&key, &(current_value + value));
        Val::from("Player trained successfully")
    }
}
```

### 2. Cross-Contract Calls

#### Purpose

Leverage Soroban's capability to interact with other contracts for functionalities like price fetching or liquidity checks to support trading and tournament features.

#### Cross-Contract Implementation in Rust

##### Liquidity Management

```rust
use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, Env, Symbol, BigInt, Val};

pub struct LiquidityContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl LiquidityContract {
    pub fn add_liquidity(env: Env, token_a: Symbol, token_b: Symbol, amount_a: BigInt, amount_b: BigInt) -> Val {
        // Liquidity addition logic
        Val::from("Liquidity added successfully")
    }
}
```

##### Trading

```rust
use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, Env, Address, Symbol, BigInt, Val};

pub struct TradingContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl TradingContract {
    pub fn execute_trade(env: Env, token_a: Symbol, token_b: Symbol, amount: BigInt) -> Val {
        let liquidity_contract: LiquidityContractClient = env.get_contract("liquidity_contract_address");
        liquidity_contract.add_liquidity(env.clone(), token_a, token_b, amount.clone(), amount.clone());
        // Further trading logic
        Val::from("Trade executed successfully")
    }
}
```

### 3. Integration with DEXes and Bridges

#### Purpose

Integrate with Stellar DEXes and external platforms to facilitate the buying and selling of NFTs and cross-chain token swaps.

#### Stellar Elements Needed

- **Horizon API**: Interact with Stellar's blockchain for transaction submissions and account monitoring.
- **Stellar Core**: Engage directly with the Stellar network for consensus and transaction processing.

#### Integration Strategy

1. **API Integration and Configuration**

   - Integrate with StellarX and StellarTerm APIs to perform trades.
   - Use Allbridge and Changelly APIs for cross-chain token swaps.

2. **Unified Interface Development**

   - Develop a cohesive user interface that proposes the best routes and handles transactions seamlessly.

3. **Smart Contract Implementation for Automated Routing**

   - Use Soroban smart contracts to automate decision-making for optimal swap routes based on real-time data from integrated services.

4. **Security**

   - Implement stringent security protocols for interacting with external APIs.

5. **Performance Optimization and Cost Management**

   - Optimize performance and reduce transaction fees.
   - Provide transparent cost comparisons for users.

6. **Continuous Monitoring and Updates**
   - Monitor the operational status and updates from integrated DEXes and bridges.
   - Adjust integrations based on performance metrics and user feedback.

### Benefits

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Users access a wide range of services for trading and transferring assets across multiple blockchains.
- **Optimization of Swaps**: Automated calculations ensure users get the best possible rates.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: A streamlined interface simplifies complex blockchain interactions.

### 4. Backend Service Development in Elixir

#### Purpose

Develop a backend service in Elixir to handle off-chain activities such as creating teams, managing team rosters, and creating tournaments.

#### Implementation Plan

##### User and Team Management

```Elixir
defmodule ProSoccerService do
  alias ProSoccer.DB

  def register_user(wallet_adress) do
    user = %{wallet_adress: wallet_adress}
    :ok = DB.save_user(user)
    "User registered successfully"
  end

  def create_team(user_id, team_name) do
    team = %{user_id: user_id, team_name: team_name, players: []}
    :ok = DB.save_team(team)
    "Team created successfully"
  end

  def buy_player(user_id, player_id) do
    case DB.get_team_by_user_id(user_id) do
      nil ->
        raise "Team not found"
      team ->
        updated_team = Map.update!(team, :players, &[player_id | &1])
        :ok = DB.update_team(updated_team)
        "Player added to team successfully"
    end
  end

  def create_tournament(user_id, tournament_details) do
    tournament = Map.put_new(tournament_details, :creator, user_id)
                |> Map.put_new(:participants, [])
    :ok = DB.save_tournament(tournament)
    "Tournament created successfully"
  end

  def participate_tournament(user_id, tournament_id, player_ids) do
    case DB.get_tournament_by_id(tournament_id) do
      nil ->
        raise "Tournament not found"
      tournament ->
        updated_tournament = Map.update!(tournament, :participants, &[{user_id, player_ids} | &1])
        :ok = DB.update_tournament(updated_tournament)
        "User participated in tournament successfully"
    end
  end
end


defmodule ProSoccer.Service do
  alias ProSoccerService

    def register_user(wallet_adress) do
        ProSoccerService.register_user(wallet_adress)
    end

  def create_team(user_id, team_name) do
    ProSoccerService.create_team(user_id, team_name)
  end

  def create_tournament(user_id, tournament_details) do
    ProSoccerService.create_tournament(user_id, tournament_details)
  end

  def participate_tournament(user_id, tournament_id, player_ids) do
    ProSoccerService.participate_tournament(user_id, tournament_id, player_ids)
  end
end

```

### Conclusion

ProSoccer leverages Stellar's ecosystem, using Soroban smart contracts and integration with DEXes and bridges to create a dynamic, user-focused platform. Additionally, an Elixir backend service will handle off-chain activities such as creating teams, managing rosters, and organizing tournaments. This comprehensive approach ensures efficient transactions, low fees, and an enhanced gaming experience for soccer fans and blockchain enthusiasts.
